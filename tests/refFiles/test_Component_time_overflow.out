FATAL:  SST Core: ERROR: SST Core detected a time fault (an event had an earlier time than the previous event). The most likely cause of this is that the 64-bit core time had an overflow condition.  This is typically caused by having low frequency events with too low of a timebase.  See the extended help for --timebase option (sst --help timebase)

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 5.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
