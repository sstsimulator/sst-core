""" This module provides the basic SSTTestCase class (based upon Python's
    unittest.TestCase) for the SST Test Frameworks.

    SST Tests are expected to derive a class from SSTTestCase to create testssuites.
    Its general operation follows Pythons unittest Frameworks and users should
    reference Pythons documentation for more info.

    There are a number of methods within the class to provide support tools for the
    test developer.  More support functions exist within sst_unittest_support.py
