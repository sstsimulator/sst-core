Performs a linear partition scheme of an SST simulation configuration. In this
scheme a list of components (supplied as a graph) are grouped by slicing the list
into approximately equal parts. A "part" is generated for each MPI rank performing
the simulation. This means Components with sequential ids will be placed close together.
In general this scheme provides a very effective partition for most parallel
simulations which generate man similar components of interest close together in the input
Python configuration. It is also very fast to compute a linear partition scheme. For
more aggressive partition schemes users should try either a simple or Zoltan-based
partitioner.
